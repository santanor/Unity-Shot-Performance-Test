Unity-Shot-Performance-Test
===========================

This is a performance test about shooting bullets in Unity. The test will be divided in two parts. The first one will create a bullet each time it's needed

The second one will create a bag of bullets and will be moving them around the map. 

The objetive is to see the change in the performance in the game, using both methods.


The code is in the 'Develop' branch, feel free to make any pull request improving my job, but don't forget to explain why your way is better so I can learn from it :P
